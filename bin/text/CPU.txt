In the CPU section, you'll see three things; 
The CPU Model, CPU Usage, and CPU Frequency. 
The CPU Model is the name, family, 
and model number of the CPU running in your system. 
CPUs are typically split up into families, 
where a new generation of CPUs is a "family." 


Typically, the details are not important to a 
average user, but when it comes to upgrades or 
replacements, this info is important.


Next is the CPU Usage, this is the amount 
of your CPU's processing power is currently 
being used by your OS. 
More intense programs use more CPU. 


The most complicated part of the CPU info, is 
the frequency. CPU's and other similar parts run at a certain clock speed, which is the rate the 
processor performs operations.
This is measured GHz in today's speeds. 
Older CPU's might be measured at MHz. 

1 GHz is 1000 MHz
1 MHz = 1000 KHz
1KHz = 1000 Hz
