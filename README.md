# Simple-System-Monitor
This GUI application is designed to display simple system stats, and also have a helpful manual for users to gain a understanding of what they are looking at. This is a project for college.



### It requires psutil, PIL and of course tkinter.

You can install them using:
>py -m pip psutil

>py -m pip pillow 

>py -m pip tkinter





# Features

## Main Window
When you open the program it should look something like this:

You can see that the main program contains the stats, which includes CPU, RAM and Hard Drives. At the bottom is an Exit button and Refresh button. The Exit button is self explantory, and the refresh button simply refreshs the window, for say if you put in a USB drive and you want it displayed.

## Menus
They're are two menus, one for account related windows and one for helpful info.

### Account Menu
The account menu contains one item at the moment, the "Create Account" item. It will lead you to this:

Each item in the tree has a respective text file explaining components of the program.



The about item when clicked will open a simple about menu, with the program verision on contact info for myself:
